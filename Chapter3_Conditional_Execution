3.1
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
hours = float(hrs)
rte = raw_input("Enter Rate:")
rate = float(rte)
if hours <= 40:
    total = rate * hours
else:
    total = (hours - 40)*(1.5*rate) + (40 * rate)
print total


3.3
Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 
If the score is out of range, print an error. 
If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade,

grade = raw_input("Please enter numerical grade:")
g = float(grade)
if g > 1.0 or g < 0.0:
    print "Error.  Value out of range."
elif g >= 0.9:
    print "A"
elif g >= 0.8:
    print "B"
elif g >= 0.7:
    print "C"
elif g >= 0.6:
    print "D"
elif g < 0.6:
    print "F"
