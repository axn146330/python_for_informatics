2.2
Write a program that uses raw_input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. 
Note that raw_input will pop up a dialog box.

name = raw_input("Enter your name")
print "Hello", name


2.3
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay.

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
hours = float(hrs)
rte = raw_input("Enter Rate:")
rate = float(rte)
total = hours*rate
print total

#We need floating point numbers to calculate gross pay.
#The "raw_input" returns a string to us, so we must convert this to a float.
