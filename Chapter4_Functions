Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() 
and use the function to do the computation. 
The function should return a value.

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
h = float(hrs)
rate = raw_input("Enter Hourly Rate of Pay:")
r = float(rate)

def computepay(h,r):
    if h <= 40:
        total = h * r
    elif h > 40:
        total = 40 * r + (r * 1.5 * (h - 40))
    return total
print computepay(h,r)
