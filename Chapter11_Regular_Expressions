Finding Numbers in a Haystack

In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. 
You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.

import re

text = raw_input("Enter file: ") + ".txt"
hand = open(text)
y = []
total = 0
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    numbers = re.findall('[0-9]+', line)
    if len(numbers) < 1:
        continue
    y += numbers
for number in y:
    num = int(number)
    total += num
print total
