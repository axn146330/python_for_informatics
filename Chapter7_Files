7.1
Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
and print the contents of the file in upper case.

# Use words.txt as the file name
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
for lines in fh:
    lines = lines.rstrip()
    print lines.upper()


7.2
Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values.

# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
count = 0
total = 0
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):
        continue
    count += 1
    zero = line.find("0.")
    numbers = line[zero:]
    number = float(numbers)
    total = total + number
print "Average spam confidence:", (total/count)
