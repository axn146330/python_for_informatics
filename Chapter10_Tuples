Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour.

count = dict()
name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        line = line.split()
        email = line[5]
        email = email.split(":")
        hour = email[0]
        count[hour] = count.get(hour, 0) + 1
hourslist = []
for hour, counts in count.items():
    hourslist.append((hour, counts))
hourslist.sort()
for hour, counts in hourslist:
    print hour, counts
